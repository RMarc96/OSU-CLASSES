		I'm completely new to using Git/GitHub, so those tutorials linked in the assignment page were very helpful.

		</li>

		In the past, I was familiar with GitHub and its use as a code repository, but I've never gone on there to use it myself.
		I've tried learning HTML in the past but I didn't get very far.
		This assignment taught me how to use different tags, e.g. using 'img' to embed images.
