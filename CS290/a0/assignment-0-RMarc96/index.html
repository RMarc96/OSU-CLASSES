			<li> My name is Ronald Salinas </li>
			<li> I am currently a junior majoring in computer science </li>
			<li> On a scale from 0 to 10, I'd give my web development skills a 1 </li>
				<ul>
					<li> I've fiddled around with HTML before, but I never really looked at anything other than the basics </li>
					<li> I currently have no experience in CSS and Javascripts
				</ul>
			<li> I hope to learn more about these HTML, CSS, and JS so that I may be able to make a web app of my own so that my friends and family can use it </li>
			<li> Yes, I have signed up for Piazza </li>
			<li> It may seem impressive to some or may not seem impressive at all, but I can solve a completely scrambled Rubik's cube pretty fast </li>
				<ul>
					<li> Cube solving was a great way for me to de-stress during high school. The more I solved, the faster I became.
						I would optimize my solving times by turning the faces of the cube using different finger tricks 
						and learned various algorithms manipulate the positions of each cubelet.
						16 seconds is my current record.
					</li>
				</ul>
